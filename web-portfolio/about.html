        <h3>ABOUT CHLOE</h3>
        <p>I began taking a serious interest in art in high school when I took a Graphic Design class in grade 11. I excelled and continued with it in grade 12. I decided I wanted to do this for a living and make a successful career with it. I got accepted into the Graphic Design program at Georgian College. Here I learned Adobe Creative Cloud a long with Photography, Package Design, and the Printing Process. After graduating I decided I wanted to learn more about Wed Design. I then got accepted into Algonquin College for Interactive Media Design. Here I learned more in detail with HTML, CSS & Javascript. I also learned Drupal, Wordpress & Shopify. With these skills I hope to grow as a designer and become more successful every day.</p>
