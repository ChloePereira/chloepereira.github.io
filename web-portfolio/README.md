My Public GitHub Pages Site For the design of this project, I wanted my overall layout of the webpage to be quite simple. I wanted to incorporate the colour I chose for my personal logo so it would have a flow throughout. I kept the colour pretty neutrual because I wanted my art and past work to be the main focus. I found it difficult to get my webpage to look exactly like my prototype, because I had some problems with grid. It's just something I need to practice more. Overall, I am pleased with the final result.
